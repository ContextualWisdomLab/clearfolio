## 2026-06-30 - Prevent DOM-based XSS in Viewer JS
**Vulnerability:** Untrusted paths from API responses were directly assigned to `a.href` and used in `iframe` generation, which allows execution of malicious URIs like `javascript:` or `data:`.
**Learning:** Even when avoiding `innerHTML`, directly setting URL-like strings to DOM attributes without protocol validation introduces XSS vectors. The payload can be executed when the link is clicked or the iframe is loaded.
**Prevention:** Implement an `isSafeUrl` verification function to ensure the protocol is strictly `http:` or `https:` (using `new URL()`) before assigning untrusted inputs to DOM attributes like `href` or `src`.

## 2026-07-02 - Cryptographic Signature Verification Bypass in Policy Override
**Vulnerability:** The document validation service logged the presence of policy override parameters (approverId, approvalToken) but failed to actually verify the cryptographic signature of the token against a shared secret. This allowed an attacker to bypass file extension restrictions (e.g., uploading blocked `.hwp` files) by sending any arbitrary token.
**Learning:** Checking for the presence of security tokens is insufficient if the token payload and signature are not cryptographically validated against a trusted secret. The absence of this check created a critical authorization bypass.
**Prevention:** Always verify cryptographic signatures (using constant-time comparison like `MessageDigest.isEqual`) for any policy override or authorization token before granting the elevated privilege or bypassing a security control.
